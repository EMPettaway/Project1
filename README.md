**Technologies Used
This project was written in VSCode using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Problems
There were certain key elements of my game I was unfortunately unable to figure out how to get working in the alloted time such as cards that arent matches to "flip" back over, the timer to work the way I intended for it to work (and not the work around in this current version) and a way to keep track of how many matches the player has.
