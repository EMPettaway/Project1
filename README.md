**Technologies Used
This project was written in VSCode using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Problems
There were certain key elements of my game I was unfortunately unable to figure out how to get working in the alloted time such as cards that arent matches to "flip" back over, the timer to work the way I intended for it to work (and not the work around in this current version) and a way to keep track of how many matches the player has.

**User Stories

MVP Goals
-As a player, I would like to be able to select any card I want.
-As a player, I want to know when the timer will begin.
-As a player, I would like to see how many matches I have as the game goes on (score being kept).
-As a player, I would like to be able to reset the game after my round is over.
-As a player, I would like the cards to flip over once clicked.
-As a player, I would like the cards i've already matched to stay face up.

Stretch Goals
-As a player, I would like scores to be logged onto a leaderboard.
-As a player, I would like to select between the theme of cards I am matching.
